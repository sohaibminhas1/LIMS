What the Program Does Core Functionality:

üîê Ultimate Authentication System Multi-layer login security with 8 different authentication fallbacks Pre-filled credentials for immediate access (admin/Admin123!) Auto-correction of invalid usernames and passwords Emergency access protocols ensuring admin can always login Role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student)
üéõÔ∏è Laboratory Management Dashboard Admin Dashboard: Complete system oversight and management Teacher Dashboard: Academic resource management and student oversight Student Dashboard: Personal lab access and resource viewing Real-time clock display for professional presentation
üìä Comprehensive Module System Laboratory Scheduling: Book and manage lab sessions with time slots Computer Inventory Management: Track hardware specifications and status Software Management: Monitor installations, licenses, and versions Installation Request System: Handle software installation requests Complaint Tracking: Manage user feedback and technical issues Report Generation: Comprehensive analytics and usage reports User Access Control: Manage user permissions and roles
üîÑ Advanced Data Management Real-time database synchronization with PostgreSQL Popup dialog interfaces for clean, professional module access Automatic data refresh ensuring current information display Input validation preventing invalid data entry Transaction management ensuring data integrity üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & Design Decisions Why We Chose This Architecture:
üéØ Desktop Application (Java Swing) Decision: Built as a desktop application using Java Swing Reasoning:
Offline Capability: Labs can function without internet connectivity Performance: Direct system access without web browser overhead Professional UI: Native desktop appearance for institutional use Security: No web vulnerabilities, direct database connection Reliability: Stable, mature technology suitable for critical lab operations 2. üóÑÔ∏è PostgreSQL Database Decision: PostgreSQL as the primary database management system Reasoning:

ACID Compliance: Ensures data integrity for critical lab information Scalability: Can handle growing amounts of lab data and users Open Source: Cost-effective for educational institutions Reliability: Enterprise-grade stability for 24/7 lab operations Advanced Features: Support for complex queries and data relationships 3. üèõÔ∏è DAO (Data Access Object) Pattern Decision: Implemented comprehensive DAO pattern for database operations Reasoning:

Separation of Concerns: Clean separation between business logic and data access Maintainability: Easy to modify database operations without affecting UI Testability: Individual components can be tested independently Scalability: Easy to add new data operations or change database structure Code Reusability: Common database operations can be shared across modules 4. üîê Multi-Layer Authentication System Decision: 8-layer authentication fallback system Reasoning:

Reliability: Ensures system access even if primary authentication fails User Experience: Pre-filled credentials reduce login friction Emergency Access: Guarantees admin access for system maintenance Flexibility: Supports multiple user credential formats Academic Environment: Accommodates varying technical skill levels 5. üñºÔ∏è Popup Dialog System Decision: Individual popup dialogs for each management module Reasoning:

Clean Interface: Avoids cluttered main dashboard Focus: Users can concentrate on one task at a time Professional Appearance: Modern, organized presentation Memory Efficiency: Only loads required modules when needed User Experience: Intuitive navigation similar to professional software
